Rugby Ranker is a **work-in-progress** Android app for viewing and predicting the latest World Rugby rankings.

It displays the latest international rankings, live scores, fixtures, results and news/videos. It makes use of the [World Rugby 'Points Exchange' system](https://www.world.rugby/rankings/explanation) in order to predict changes in team positions and points.

## Android development

Rugby Ranker attempts to make use of the latest Android libraries and best practices:
* Entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (including [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html)) with [ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint) for code style
* Makes use of [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/):
  * [Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/arch/) including **ViewModel**, **LiveData**, **Room**, **Paging**, **Navigation**, **WorkManager** and **DataStore**
  * [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout), [ViewPager2](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/viewpager2/widget/ViewPager2), [View Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) and more for layouts and UI
  * [Emoji2](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/emoji2) for emoji compatibility on older platforms
  * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) for more fluent use of Android APIs
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)/[OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) for networking
* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) for image loading
* [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection
* Designed and built using Material Design [components](https://material.io/components/) and [theming](https://material.io/design/material-theming/overview.html#material-theming)
* Full [dark theme](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html) support
* Meaningful use of [Material Motion](https://material.io/design/motion/the-motion-system.html) transitions
* Edge-to-edge support using [Insetter](https://github.com/chrisbanes/insetter)
* Slowly migrating to [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) (see the [compose](https://github.com/ricknout/rugby-ranker/tree/compose) branch)

## Inspiration

Rugby Ranker was inspired by [@rawling](https://github.com/rawling)'s [wr-calc](https://rawling.github.io/wr-calc/) web app, aiming to be a native Android version with a focus on delightful UX/UI design.
